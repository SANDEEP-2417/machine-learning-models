# Project Title: Cement Strength Prediction using Keras Neural Network Regression


# Description

In this project, we build a Keras neural network for predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its material composition. By analyzing features such as cement, slag, and age, our regression model estimates concrete strength. The goal is to assist in assessing concrete quality and durability.

# Key Features
1.Utilizes Keras (built on TensorFlow) for neural network implementation.
2.Trains on the Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set.
3.Predicts concrete strength based on material attributes.
4.Provides accurate regression modeling.

# Getting Started
1.Clone this repository.
2.Install required dependencies (Keras, TensorFlow, etc.).
3.Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for model training.
4.Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.

# Usage
1.Input concrete material features (cement, slag, etc.).
2.Obtain predicted compressive strength.
